Project 01: Creation of a game. 

For this game, the user will have a ball(circle) that the user will select the laters where the ball should move to climb to the top. The user must take the ball(circle) the highest it can be to gain score. if it let the ball touch down, game over. In the process of the game the dificulty rate will rise depending on the score you have for that moment. Some obstacles could be fasting the pace to reach to the top. It will get the Name and score and show the user's name and Score achived. 

In terms of coding: 

  We used almost every possible technique available to design this game. loops, conditions, functions, list, variables, strings etc. We tried to design the program in a modular form. Also, used libraries like graphics for creating the GUI. I created my own code for refreshing the figures. Although due to time, I didnt had the time and other clases to make it run as perfectly as I wanted but it works in some way in a basic way as intented. That would be it.
