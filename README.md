Project 01: Creation of a game. 

For this game, the user will have a ball(circle) that the user will select the laters where the ball should move to climb to the top. The user must take the ball(circle) the highest it can be to gain score. If it let the ball touch down, game over. In the process of the game the dificulty rate will rise depending on the score you have for that moment. Some obstacles could be fasting the pace to reach to the top. It will get the Name and score and show the user's name and Score achived. 

In terms of coding: 

  We used almost every possible technique available to design this game. Classes,loops, conditions, functions, list, variables, strings etc. We design the program in a modular form. Also, used libraries like graphics for creating the GUI. I created my own code for refreshing the figures. Different fro project #1 here we corrected the prpoblems and add it clases now the Game is running as intented.
